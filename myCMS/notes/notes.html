    <h3>Buffering output</h3>
    <p>
      Increasing and allowing buffering on the server, increases the time allowed in a delay. We increase it inside the <em>php.ini</em> file, <code>output_buffering=4096</code> and we can check it in the <code>phpinfo()</code>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To change or start the buffering process, programmatically, we would use a function:
      <?php 
        ob_start();
      ?>
      We always use that function at the top of the page, that way we can use a header function:
      <?php 
        header("Location: index.php");
      ?>
    </p>
